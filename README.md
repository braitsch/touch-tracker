####Simple Air App to Test Hardware Capabilities on Touchscreens

A quick way to check what touch, gestures and mouse events your hardware supports.
Includes a basic view that animates random circles on the screen on MouseMove events.

This was intended as just a quick way to get hardware feedback while drawing something pretty to the screen.

Mac and PC builds are available in the /app folder or download the repo and compile the ANT build yourself if you wish to make changes.

To bring up the menu, touch down or mouse down at the top of the screen for 5 seconds.

Comments and suggestions for improvements are welcome.
